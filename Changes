0.100160  2010-01-16 06:10:12 Europe/Oslo
        - Switch to filehandles for storing data, should perform better
        - Better documentation about return values [Marcus Ramberg]
        INCOMPAT: The return value for add_request is changed. It now returns
                  the WWW::Curl::Simple::Request-object that was added.
        - Added has_request and delete_request to help with multi-request
          handling [RT#46293]

        New options:
          - timeout: Set timeout for content in seconds
          - connection_timeout: Set timeout for connection in seconds
          - fatal: (defaults to true), if false, will carp, not croak, on errors.

        Set a default UserAgent header, since some services seem to require a
        UserAgent header.

0.03    2009-04-20 09:32:00+0200
        Bump version.

0.02    2009-04-20 09:11:00+0200
        INCOMPAT: Fix some compat issues with LWP::Parallel::UserAgent.
                  We now return an hash like they do, with objects that have the
                  same methods
        INCOMPAT: $curl->perform on a multi-request now returns objects that have
                  ->request and ->response methods, instead of the ->response
                  directly.

        Fix really bad response-fuckup.

0.01    2009-04-14 09:37:00+0200
        First version, very basic interface. Does not support everything yet
